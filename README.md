# Hello, World! (Deployed on ECS Fargate)

## Installing requirements

Requires Python 3.8 or later.

The requirements can then be installed using pip:

```
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the app

```
uvicorn hello.main:app
```

The app will listen on port 8000.

http://127.0.0.1:8000

The greeting can be configured with an query parameter:

Terraform code to deploy and serve and application running on ECS Fargate.

## Architecture

![Alt text](images/ecs-fargate.png?raw=true "Architecture")

## Resources used

The Terraform code includes the following resources:
| Resource        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| VPC      | Virtual private network to launch our resource in. Our Terraform identifies and uses the default VPC for our region. VPCs exist in one region but span multiple Availibility Zones. |
| Subnets      | Subnet (sub-network) is a smaller network in your VPC. Subnets can only be in one Availibility Zone. Subnets can be configured to be public (accessible from the internet) or private. Our subnets are configured to auto-assign IP settings, meaning a public IP is automatically requested for subnet's network interface. |
| Internet Gateway | Internet gateways are attached to VPCs to allow connections (inbound and outbound connections) between VPCs and the internet. An alternative to an Internet Gateway is a NAT Gateway, which only allows outbound connections. Our Terraform uses the default Internet Gateway associated with the default VPC. |
| Route Tables | Route tables contain rules (routes) used to determine how traffic is directed in our VPC. We're only using the main route table that comes with the default VPC. Our route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC and a route to direct all outbound traffic through our internet gateway.
| Network ACLs | Network Access Control Lists define what inbound and outbound traffic is allowed or denyed at a subnet level. Our subnets use the default Network ACLs which allow all traffic inbound and outbound.
| Security Groups | Security Groups define what traffic is allow to and from resources.
| Load Balancer | Load balancers accept incoming traffic and route it to resources, in this case ECS.
| Load Balancer Listener | Listeners check for connection requests on the defined protocol and port. In our code that HTTP traffic over port 80.
| Load Balancer Target Group | Target groups tell load balancers where to direct traffic to.
| ECS Cluster | Group of tasks or services. The underlying infrastructure can be provided by Fargate, EC2, on-prem servers or VMs/
| ECS Capacity Provider | Capacity providers defines which underlying infrastructure should be used.
| ECS Service | Collection of ECS tasks.
| Fargate Task | Defines the containers and allocated resources.


## Â Deploying from the command line

Use the commands below to deploy the infrastructure using the command line. Update the init command with your own backend configuration.

### CD into terraform directory

```bash
cd terraform
export AWS_PROFILE=personal
```

### Init

```bash
terraform init -no-color -force-copy -input=false -upgrade=true -backend=true \
  -backend-config="bucket=terraform-states-oxkycy" \
  -backend-config="key=tf-terraform-states-oxkycy.tfstate" \
  -backend-config="region=eu-west-2" \
  -backend-config="dynamodb_table=terraform-states" \
  -backend-config="encrypt=true"
```

### Plan

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan 
```

### Apply

```bash
terraform apply -input=false -no-color -input=false tfplan 
```

### Delete

```bash
terraform plan -destroy -out=tfplan && \
terraform apply -destroy -input=false -no-color tfplan 
```

## Notes

```bash
docker build . -t hello
docker run --rm -it  -p 8000:8000/tcp hello:latest
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/?name=Dave

docker run --rm -it \
    --name test-pod \
    --network host \
    -p 8000:8000/tcp \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -w /app \
    --entrypoint "/bin/bash" \
    python:3
